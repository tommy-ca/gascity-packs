## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Remaining program units stay host sling then compiler then panel stamp

Feature: pstack-delivery-evidence

Rule: Isolation on feat/pstack-pack-honesty does not authorize restamp or panel stamp

The live program MUST name isolation on branch `feat/pstack-pack-honesty`.
gastownhall PR 385 is closed unmerged. It is not the land vehicle. The program
MUST NOT reopen it as the merge path. The live program MUST name host sling of
`pstack-poteto-mode` then `pstack-build` as the next operator unit after
isolation is in this tree. That unit MUST NOT be a GitHub PR. Restamp of
registry `0.1.0` MUST wait on those sling receipts. It MUST NOT treat a GitHub
PR as the restamp vehicle. `pstack/TRACEABILITY.md` MUST name both formulas
on the restamp gate. The program MUST say `pr-pstack-panel-stamp` must not
start on Gherkin alone. Pack tests MUST fail if any
`pstack/formulas/*.formula.toml` contains `gc.provider_panel` or
`gc.child_artifact_path_template`. Pack tests MUST fail if `gascity/` contains
`provider_panel`. Presence of `openspec/specs/gascity-provider-panel/spec.md`
MUST NOT authorize a formula stamp. The boot recipe and REQUIREMENTS MUST
validate `openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-02-pstack-mapping-gaps` without
`--change`. Operator publication dest is registry.gascity.com. This change
MUST NOT publish.

#### Scenario: Host sling is the next operator unit

- **GIVEN** `docs/pstack-program-plan.md`
- **WHEN** an operator follows the spawn graph after isolation is on `feat/pstack-pack-honesty`
- **THEN** the next unit names host sling of `pstack-poteto-mode` and `pstack-build`
- **AND** that unit is not a GitHub PR
- **AND** restamp of `registry.toml` 0.1.0 waits on sling receipts
- **AND** restamp does not use a GitHub PR as its vehicle

#### Scenario: TRACEABILITY names both sling formulas on the restamp gate

- **GIVEN** `pstack/TRACEABILITY.md`
- **WHEN** a reader follows the delivery boundary
- **THEN** it forbids restamping `commit` or `hash` without a host sling
- **AND** that sentence names `pstack-poteto-mode` and `pstack-build`

#### Scenario: Panel stamp does not start on Gherkin alone

- **GIVEN** `docs/pstack-program-plan.md` and `openspec/specs/gascity-provider-panel/spec.md`
- **WHEN** an operator considers `pr-pstack-panel-stamp`
- **THEN** the program says the compiler is outside this packs tree
- **AND** it says `pr-pstack-panel-stamp` must not start on Gherkin alone
- **AND** pack formulas still omit `gc.provider_panel`

#### Scenario: Tests fail closed on a premature panel stamp

- **GIVEN** `pstack/tests/test_pstack_pack.py`
- **WHEN** the focused pack tests run
- **THEN** every `pstack/formulas/*.formula.toml` omits `gc.provider_panel`
- **AND** every such file omits `gc.child_artifact_path_template`
- **AND** `gascity/` has no `provider_panel` hit

#### Scenario: gastownhall PR 385 is closed unmerged

- **GIVEN** `docs/pstack-program-plan.md`
- **WHEN** an operator names the isolation land vehicle
- **THEN** the program names isolation on `feat/pstack-pack-honesty`
- **AND** it says gastownhall PR 385 is closed unmerged
- **AND** it says do not reopen that PR
- **AND** operator publication dest is registry.gascity.com
- **AND** this change does not publish

#### Scenario: Boot recipe validates mapping-gaps without --change

- **GIVEN** `docs/pstack-program-plan.md` and `pstack/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- **WHEN** an operator runs the boot recipe validate-only command
- **THEN** `--source` is `openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-02-pstack-mapping-gaps`
- **AND** `--change` is omitted
- **AND** OpenSpec strict validate exits 0
